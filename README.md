Advent of Code 2019 in C
========================

Solutions in C to the puzzles of [Advent of Code
2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

Commands
--------

-   `make` to build all executables
-   `make <day>` (e.g. `make 1`) to run a program solving a specific day
-   `make test` to run all tests
-   `make time` to run all solvers and output timings
-   `make clean` to remove all files generated by `make`

In addition, `debug=1` and/or `CC=<compiler>` can be used as arguments
to `make`. For example, `make clean; make debug=1 CC=clang test` will
run all tests after building all solvers using clang with additional
warnings and flags for debugging. By default, compilation is done with
gcc.
